# Regular-Expressions-in-Python
A Comprehensive Guide for Beginners. Crucial Role in OCR Projects
In regular expressions (regex), \d and [A-Z] are special character classes that represent certain sets of characters. Let me explain each one:

\d: This is a shorthand character class that represents any digit (0-9). It is equivalent to writing [0-9]. So, when you see \d in a regex pattern, it means any numeric digit.

Example:

\d{2}: This matches exactly two consecutive digits.
[A-Z]: This is a character class that represents any uppercase letter from 'A' to 'Z'. It matches a single character that is an uppercase letter.

Example:

[A-Za-z]: This matches any uppercase or lowercase letter.
[A-F]: This matches any uppercase letter from 'A' to 'F'.
In the provided code:

\d{2}-\d{2}-\d{4} is a regex pattern that matches a date in the format "dd-mm-yyyy," where \d{2} matches two digits, the hyphen '-' matches the hyphen between the day and month, and \d{4} matches four digits for the year.

[A-Za-z]+#\d{3} is a regex pattern that matches a product ID in the format "some_letters#some_digits." [A-Za-z]+ matches one or more uppercase or lowercase letters, '#' matches the '#' symbol, and \d{3} matches exactly three digits.

So, in summary:

\d represents any digit (0-9).
[A-Z] represents any uppercase letter from 'A' to 'Z'.
